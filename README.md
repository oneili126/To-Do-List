# Basic To-Do-List
This is a very basic Python To-Do List that I created to practice Python and develop a GUI using Tkinter.

This Python To-Do List was created using VSCode. I was very excited to add some color once I was able to get the basic functionalities down.

Known Issues

I wanted to change the color of the buttons, but I have not been able to figure it out just yet. I have heard that  using VSCode on Mac can affect the ability for the colors of the buttons to change.
